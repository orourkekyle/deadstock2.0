<h2>Process</h2>



<h2>Topics</h2>
The functionality of the site includes:

* Profile pages
* Login pages
* Searching of sneakers in database
* Images along with up to date information of the sneakers from the database

<h2>Components</h2>
First, an idea was sketched with the main concept in mind that all four of us would be able to grasp and create in our heads to be able to visualize how this will be constructed fully. Tom and Kyle split up for the back end functionality and Dylan and Heather split up to work together on the front end and all four group members helped research all of the issues faced along the way. The sneaker API collects all information on the sneaker and displays them when searched for with the criteria provided on the site.

<h2>Tools</h2>

* Bootstrap
* CSS
* HTML
* JavaScript
* Passport

<h2>Issues faced</h2>
